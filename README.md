# LOCUST_IO Package

This package is designed to process input and output for the LOCUST-GPU code, developed by Rob Akers at CCFE. There are two sub-modules - input and output - which contain python objects, each representing LOCUST data.

It is designed such that individual file read/write methods can easily be swapped out if new methods/filetypes come and go - all that needs to be changed is the respective function (which would be the same amount of work as writing the function bespoke).
